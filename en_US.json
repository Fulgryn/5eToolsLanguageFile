    "answer1": "Anywhere between once a day to twice a week. To hear the latest updates, join our Discord.",
    "answer2": "We aim to fully support <b>all</b> commonly used browsers, i.e. Chrome and Firefox. We have no plans to support any Microsoft browsers. Other browsers, e.g. Safari and Opera, might work OK but you may wish to upgrade to a better browser in order to have a better experience when using the internet.",
    "answer3": "We aim to support Windows and Android; mainly because they're the devices we usually have access to. Due to the amount of information displayed we typically aim for the best look-and-feel when using a monitor rather than a smartphone screen. Similar to our browser support, you may wish to upgrade to a better supported device in order to have a more secure / better experience when using the internet.",
    "answer4": "On most of the pages we have filters. By default we include and/or exclude certain things. The filter will include anything that's blue and exclude anything that's red. For example, if you want to see all spells from Xanathar's Guide to Everything that a Warlock can use but can't be used by a Wizard then you need to have \"Xanathar's Guide to Everything\" and \"Warlock\" in blue and \"Wizard\" in red - when you're in the Filter drop-down clicking an icon cycles the color from white (it doesn't matter either way) to blue (include these things) to red (exclude these things). If you get lost then simply click the Reset button and the filtering will go back to the default for that page.",
    "answer5": "Yes - it does; that's because we want to keep improving this site. We rarely delete data, but it may appear to be \"missing\"; that's often due to the filter settings. If you find entries are wrong then please let us know, e.g. using Discord or raise an issue in GitHub; we're typically very responsive. Similarly, if you have any good suggestions for improvements then we're up for that too! No change is too small to tell us about, e.g. spelling mistakes and links not working, but the bigger changes might take some time to get to the top of our priority list.",
    "answer6": "Much of the content includes hyperlinks to other parts of our site. Similarly, other things may look like links but they're often die-rollers, e.g. click on a 1d4+2 and we'll do the dice rolling for you and the results appear at the bottom of the screen. If in doubt, give it a click and see what it does!",
    "answer7": "Night Mode, with a dark background and lighter text, is a relatively recent new feature and we're still putting the finishing touches to its look-and-feel.",
    "answer8": "If you click on the column name in a table then the data in that column is sorted; clicking on it again will reverse the sort direction. Where possible, we've tried to be logical about the sorting, e.g. Self then touch then various distances then Unlimited and Special at the far end; some of the sorting is still work-in-progress - if you have any good ideas on how to improve it please let us know, e.g. sorting by Ability in Feats.",
    "answer9": "Some of the things on the page will pop-up a tooltip if you hover the mouse over them, e.g. our source abbreviations will pop-up with the full name of the source. Actions and skill checks also have tooltips on some pages.",
